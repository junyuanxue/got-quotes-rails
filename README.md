# Game of Thrones Generator

## About :crown:

This is the server for my React web app [Game of Thrones Quotes Generator](https://github.com/junyuanxue/got-quotes-generator). It is built with Ruby on Rails and test-driven with RSpec-Capybara.

One might ask since there is a [GoT Quotes API](https://github.com/wsizoo/game-of-thrones-quotes) already, why am I building another? Well, this one would allow a user to add more quotes. But I think the main reason is I miss Rails and TDD.

## To use GoT Quotes Generator :speech_balloon:


## Tools :wrench:
* Ruby on Rails
* RSpec-Capybara
* Factory Girl
* Faker
* [GoT Quotes API](https://github.com/wsizoo/game-of-thrones-quotes)
